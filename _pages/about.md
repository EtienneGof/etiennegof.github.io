Welcome! I am a Researcher at [Technlogy Innovation Institute](https://tii.ae) - [Artificial Intelligence Research Center](https://www.tii.ae/ai-and-digital-science/our-research#heading-1667), on the topic of extreme-scale model training and applications.

I was formerly a PhD student at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/), the Computer Science Laboratory of [Sorbonne - Paris Nord University](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/), in collaboration with the car manufacturer [Groupe Renault](https://group.renault.com/) and on the topic of analytical tools development for the validation of autonomous driving behaviors. 

My research interests include, but are not limited to, natural language processing, code generation, time-series unsupervised classification, model-based analysis and scalable algorithms. 

Prior to these positions, I worked for several years at [Inria Lille](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-lille-nord-europe) Research Center as a Technology Transfer Engineer, and before that at Decathlon as a Data Engineer.
